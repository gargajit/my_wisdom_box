    <h1>IFS: Internal Family Systems</h1>
    <p>
        IFS espouses a different paradigm of multiplicity, the possibility that you and everybody else is a multiple personality. <br>
        It is opposite to the mono-mind belief system - the idea that you have one mind, out of which ifferent thoughts and emotions and 
        impulses and urges emanate. 
    </p>
    <h2>Issue with mono-mind paradigm</h2>
    <p>
        The mono-mind paradigm has caused us to fear our parts and view them as pathological. In our attempts to control what 
        we consider to be disturbing thoughts and emotions, we just end up fighting, ignoring, disciplining, hiding, or feeling ashamed 
        of those impulses hat keep us from doing what we want to do in our lives. And then we shame ourselves for not being able to 
        control them. In other words, we hate what gets in our way.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you fear giving presentation, for example, you might try to use willpower to override the fear or correct it with rational thoughts. 
        If the fear persists, you might escalate your attempts to control by criticizing yourself for being a coward, 
        numbing yourself into oblivion, or meditating to climb above it. <br>
        And when none of those approaches work, you wind up adapting your life to the fear—avoiding situations 
        where you have to speak in public, feeling like a failure, and wondering what's wrong with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you go to a therapist who gives you a diagnosis for your one, troubled mind. <br>
        The diagnosis makes you feel defective, your self-esteem drops and your feelings of shame lead you to attempt to hide 
        any flaws and present a perect image to the world. <br>
        Or maybe you just withdraw from relationships for fear that people will see behnd your mask and will judge you for it. 
        You identify with your weaknesses, assuming that who you really are is defective and that if other perople saw the real you, 
        they'd be repulsed.
    </p>
    <h3>Willpower and Shame</h3>
    <p>
        The mono-mind perspective, in combination with scientific, religious or assertions of generations of philosophers and politicians 
        have asserted about how primitive human impulses are, creating this backdrop of inner polarizations. <br>
        <br>
        The emphasis on willpower and self-control permeates many cultures. We think we should be able to discipline our 
        primitive, impulsive, sinful minds through willpower. <br>
        Because this willpower ethic has become internalized, we learn at an early age to shame and manhandle our unruly parts. 
        We simply wrestle them into submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        We often find that the harder we try to get rid of emotions and thoughts, the stronger they become. 
        This is because parts, like people, fight back against being shamed or exiled. And if we do succeed in dominating them 
        with punitive self-discipline, we then become tyrannized by the rigid, controlling inner drill sergeant. 
        We might be disciplined, but we're not much fun. And because the exiled (bingeing, raging, hypersexual, etc.) parts 
        will seize any momentary weakness to break out again and take over, we have to constantly be on guard against any people or 
        situations that might trigger those parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The larger point I want to make here is that any approach that increases your inner drill sergeant's impulse 
        to shame you into behaving (and make you feel like a failure if you can't) will do no better in internal families 
        than it does in external ones in which parents adopt shaming tactics to control their children. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't think that this critique of willpower reveals that there's no room for inner discipline in <b>IFS</b>. 
        Like children in external families, we each have parts that want things that aren't good for them or for the rest of the system. 
        The difference here is that the Self says no to impulsive parts firmly but <b>from a place of love and patience</b>, 
        in just the same way an ideal parent would.
    </p>
    <h3>Inner Criticism</h3>
    <p>
        Be mindful of inner critic who, when one makes a mistake, attacks mercilessly. That attack would trigger a part 
        that makes one feel totally bereft, lonely, empty and worthless. Experiencing that worthless part can be distressing. 

        Criticism is judgmental and focuses on placing blame, while critique is descriptive and focused on finding solutions. 
    </p>
    <h2>How IFS deals what mono-mind paradigm fails to do</h2>
    <p>
        IFS deals with the idea that every human has different parts instead of a mono-mind paradigm with different thoughts 
        and emotions and impulses. There can be extreme parts in a person, so according to IFS, even those parts when 
        approached from a mindful place - this respectful, open, curious place - will reveal the secret history of how 
        they were forced into the role they're in and how they're stuck in that role, terrified that if they don't do it 
        something dreadful will happen. And, that they're frozen in the past, during the traumatic times when they had to 
        take on the role. <br>
        Basically that love is the answer in the inner world, just as it is in the outer world. 
        Listening to, embracing, and loving parts allows them to heal and transform as much as it does for people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another theme this book explores is how it's all parallel — how we relate in the inner world will be 
        how we relate in the outer. If we can appreciate and have compassion for our parts, 
        even for the ones we've considered to be enemies, we can do the same for people who resemble them. 
        On the other hand, if we hate or disdain our parts, we'll do the same with anyone who reminds us of them.
