    <h1>Unskilled and Unaware of it</h1>
    <p><b>How difficulties in recognizing one's own incompotence lead to Inflated self-assessments.</b></p>

    <p>
        When you first start learning, you feel like you know so much. <br>
        But then later as you gain knowledge, you realise there's a lot more stuff
        out there that you don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you fall into a pit, which is called the <b>Valley of Despair</b>, 
        sometimes referred to as <b>Imposter Syndrome</b>, where even though 
        you feel like you've spent a lot of time learing the skill, 
        you feel like an imposter because you think people are going to find out
        that "I actually don't know anything."
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Both of these are exaggerations.</b>
