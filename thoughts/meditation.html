    <h1>Meditation</h1>
    <p>Meditation is a tool that will give the grace and mindfulness to ease through life.</p>
    <p>Meditation is your personal journey, <i>an intimate one.</i></p>
    <p>Meditation is your ability to retain your virtues in the face of all adversities.</p>

    <h2>Levels or Milestones of Meditation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meditation <b>as an act:</b> training your mind requires discipline and determination.</li>
        <li>Meditation becomes your <b>second nature:</b> Here effortlessness arises.</li>
        <li>Meditation becomes a <b>state of your mind:</b> You no longer do meditation, you are in meditation.</li>
        <li>Liberation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Meditation is the pathway to your highest self, transforming challenges into growth and effort into ease. 
        As you journey through its stages, meditation evolves from a conscious act into an inherent state of being. 
        In this state, you don't just practice meditationâ€”you embody it, leading to a profound liberation that 
        resonates through every aspect of life.
