    <h1>My take on: <span style="color: blueviolet;">Friendship</span></h1>
    <p>
        Friends make a lot of sense and importance. 
        I wish every human gets at the least one true friend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nurturing a friendship with the right person can have a huge impact in your life.
        Friendship in ageless. The only ingredient for a strong friendship is comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Friendship to mature takes time. With time the quality of the same friendship reaches new heights.
    </p>
    <p>
        The friendships that start with shared space has higher potential to survive the test of time. 
        Being in the same space allows for shared tasks, activities, events and challenges that instantly 
        adds to the comfort of togetherness. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Friendship is the second best thing after family, and sometimes, the best thing you can have.
