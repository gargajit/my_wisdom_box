    <h1>My take on: <span style="color: blueviolet;">Spirituality</span></h1>
    <p>Religion and SPirituality are the two hands, they work together but they are different.</p>
    <p>
        For many religious activity is also their spiritual way. For others, 
        both are separate and they prefer to keep it separate. Hence, even an atheist might 
        be in a spiritual journey.

        <b>What is Spirituality?</b> Spirituality is a personal journey towards something larger than life.
        Spirituality is a very broad concept that relates to so many things like search of meaning, purpose, 
        and connection in life or to something more, a relation with the higher power. <br>
        Therefore, it is closely knitted with religion and can involve with practices, beliefs associated 
        with religion. <br>
        For many others, it transcend beyond religion and is related to personal growth, inner peace, 
        figuring out their or place in the world.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Spirituality can manifest in various ways, which include: meditation, contemplation, involvement 
        with the society or humanity in general, or a deep appreciation for the natural world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The meaning itself can be evolving in one's lifetime.
