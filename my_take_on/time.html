    <h1>My take on: <span style="color: blueviolet;">Time</span></h1>
    <p>
        Time has many adjectives: Time is powerful, time is money, time is precious, time is limited, time is relative. <br>
        How time is defined? Before we define it, let's talk how time is seen in various religions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Christianity</b> generally views time as linear, starting from the creation of the world and moving toward an ultimate end, 
                    often described as the "End Times" or "Second Coming."
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Islam</b> also views time as linear, beginning with creation and ending with the Day of Judgment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Hinduism</b> often sees time as cyclical, involving endless cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction (Samsara). 
                The concept of Yugas (ages) represents different epochs within these cycles, with the current age being the Kali Yuga.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Judaism</b> views time as both linear and sacred. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Many <b>indigenous religions</b> perceive time as cyclical, connected to natural rhythms like seasons, 
                lunar cycles, and agricultural cycles.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In summary, the concept of time is universal across religions but its interpretation and significance vary widely. <br>
        According to  <b>Science</b>, time is considered a fundamental dimension that measures the progression of events from the past, 
        through the present, and into the future. It is often described in terms of space-time in physics, 
        where time is interwoven with the three spatial dimensions, and is affected by speed and 
        gravity as described by Einstein's theory of relativity.
