    <h1>My take on: <span style="color: blueviolet;">Religion</span></h1>
    <p>
        "Religion plays a key role in every person's life." <br>
        It's upto the person how to use religion in his/her daily discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Religion has an affect on individual and the masses. 
        Hence it becomes extra special and sincere how we should deal with the topic of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has the power to make a person experience the ecstasy of life and/or 
        make another so bitter that drives them into heinous crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Religion has the power, arguably science (yet) may not have. 
        It directs the entire discourse of humanity. 
        Therefore, the topic should be discussed with extreme caution and with mindfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Religion is mostly noble, and it talks about collective good. 
        It acts as a guide, a user manual or sometimes a light house on how to carry life 
        that might have a bigger purpose than one's day to day struggles. 
        The idea is to make the life of a religious person simple when he/she is troubled.
        The bottom line is, how one takes the religion into his/her life. 
        That makes a whole lot of difference and creates various perceptions about the 
        same concept of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
        It would not be wrong to say that the power religion holds if misunderstood can 
        have a very serious impact to the humanity. Therefore, reiterating the point that 
        the topic of religion must be dealt in utmost honesty and by all means be avoided 
        as a tool for personal or political gains.
    </p>
    <p>
        The importance of religion has been in past, is and will always be there 
        in the forseeable future.
