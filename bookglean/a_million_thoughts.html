    <h1>Spiritual Takeaways from A Million THoughts - Om Swami</h1>
    <p>
        Happiness is not a pursuit, it's a feeling.<br>
        Freedom is not a quest, it's a state.
    </p>
    <p>
        The desire in itself is not the problem. <br>
        Man suffers becuase he is too scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our thoughts fuel our habits, desires and temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason man is unhappy is because his thoughts, speech and action are not in harmony.
        Anything that is not in harmony in the play of nature is either eliminated completely or 
        forced to align. Suffering is alignment.<br>
        Question: How to harmonize? <br>
        <ul>
            <li>meditation</li>
            <li>compassion</li>
            <li>dispassion</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>When you mend the fluctuations of your conciousness you become a river that's merging in the sea.</p>

    <p>
        far behind every feeling and experience. there is the thought.
        Absence of thoughts, however, does not lead to absence of feelings. On the contrary, 
        a still mind is like the tranquil lake, it's like the calm ocean, an absolute beauty. 
        For thoughts are teh ripples in that lake, emotions are the waves in the oceans of mind. 
        They remain inseparable though - waves from ocean.

        Good meditators, or even mindful perople, transcend their thoughts by simply watching them. 
        Most thoughts are random and fickle; they are not worth pursuing. 
        Upon close exampination, you will discover that thoughts are highly ephemeral and if you 
        don't hold on to them, they disappear exactly like bubbles in water.

        Whenever you are bothered by any lingering thought, simply ask yourself the following three questions 
        and watch it become feeble in no time:
        <ul>
            <li>1. From where has this thought originated?</li>
            <li>2. Where is it traveling?</li>
            <li>Where has it disappeared?</li>
        </ul>

        As you pnder on these, you begin to understand tha anatomy of a thought; basically, its emptiness.
