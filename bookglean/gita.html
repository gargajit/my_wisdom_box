    <h1>The Gita</h1>
    <p>
        The thing to do, knowing that the universe will reward single-minded devotion
        to a cause, is to choose your cause wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure the cause is unselfish and does not hurt anyone else.
        Make sure that you are not working for it because you want something out of it,
        or because you want to show up to someone else,
        <b>but simply because it is right</b>, because it needs to be done.
