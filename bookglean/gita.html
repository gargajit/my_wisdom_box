    <h1>Takeaways from The Gita</h1>
    <p>
        The thing to do, knowing that the universe will reward single-minded devotion
        to a cause, is to choose your cause wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure the cause is unselfish and does not hurt anyone else.
        Make sure that you are not working for it because you want something out of it,
        or because you want to show up to someone else,
        <b>but simply because it is right</b>, because it needs to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Krishna: <br>
        If you perform your action simply because it needs to be done, 
        without desire for reward, without fear of consequence, 
        if you offer your action to me as a sacrifice, 
        if you are free of jealousy when you act, 
        if you remain the same whether your action brings you success or failure, <br>
        that is right action, whatever that action may be.
        <br>
        Faith + Self-discipline (Sacrifice + Hard Work) = Wisdom (leading to) -> Happiness (NO doubts + No fear). 
    </p>
    <p>
        He who does his work without loving it or hating it, 
        he who neither desires something from his work nor rejects anything about it, 
        is a man who has sacrificed everything, renounced everything.
        <br>
        The wise see clearly that the ways of renunciation and action are actually the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Renunciation does not mean walking away from action. That would count as "inaction", 
        which is rejection of action. And rejection is an action too, and a selfish one at that, 
        so you are achieving neither renunciation nor right action when you walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kind of inaction is not noble - it is lazy, cowardly, irresponsible. 
        The challenge, you see, is to strive for inaction while being fully involved in action. 
        In other words, the challenge is to strive not only for right acction but tight inaction. 
        <br>
        Blessed is the man who is able to be completely involved in action with his body and his senses, 
        while being completely steeped in inaction at his core.
        <br>
        This man's Atman is always <b>still</b>, undisturbed, unattached to the actions of his body 
        and his senses. It neither expects rewards from his action, not fears the results of his action. 
        It is neither attached to action norfoes it reject action. That is right inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsibility is a big word. And it is not quite the same thing as duty. 
        Duty is an obligation, something that you have to do, which you could be punished for not doing. 
        But Responsibility is an option - there is no rule that says you have to take it, and no one 
        can punish you for not taking it. But, according to the Gita, and according to any good 
        person's code of living, your responsibility, however unplesant it may be, is just as 
        sacred as your duty.
